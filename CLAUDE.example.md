# Coding rules

- Use English as default language for naming functions, enums, classes, variables and so on... Avoid the use of Portuguese language.
- Avoid code comments. Use code comments only for special cases where it is necessary to warning the developer about unusual situations. 
- Prefer readability when writing code.
